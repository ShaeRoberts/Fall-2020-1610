Cactus ran across the living room after a jungle toy
Sports happened I guess
I was doing this wrong for a week and I'm still mad about it
That one team beat that other team 12 to 9 9/3
Team A beat Team B because Team B didn't have their heads in the game
I don't watch sports, sooo idk what happened.
