Cactus ran across the living room after a jungle toy
Sports happened I guess
I was doing this wrong for a week and I'm still mad about it
That one team beat that other team 12 to 9 9/3
Team A beat Team B because Team B didn't have their heads in the game
I don't watch sports, sooo idk what happened.
Sports happended. Everythings on fire. This is fine.
I don't sport because asthma. So idk what to tell you.
I really don't know anything about sports.
I was supposed to get my SSD drive today, but Amazon gave the package to USPS.
I'm still mad about that.
Everyone knows that USPS doesn't deliver on Sundays!
